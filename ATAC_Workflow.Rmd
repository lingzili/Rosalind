# Introduction
Illumina NovaSeq 6000 generates FASTQ files with the naming as below:
/data/home/username/ATAC_analysis/SM4225_S5_L001_R1_001.fastq.gz

+ SM4225 is sample name.

+ S5 indicates that this is the fifth sample listed in the sample sheet.

+ L001 is lane number.

+ R1 is the read. ATAC-seq here uses paired-end run, there is another file with the file name R2.

+ 001 is always in the last segment of the FASTQ file name.

+ gz indicates that this is a compressed file.

For more information of the FASTQ format, please see: [FASTQ format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASTQ_format)

For downstream analysis, there will be two types of scripts (shell - run on linux terminal and R - run on R studio).

# Installation
Download [MobaXterm](https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/) as the terminal for solexa2 server from its website.

Programs, including R, [FastQC](https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/Help/) and [Bowtie 2](http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/bowtie2/manual.shtml), are already installed in server.

To check if a program is in the server, type in terminal:
```{bash echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
which fastqc
```
To check the program version, type in terminal:
```{bash echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
fastqc --version
```
To read documentation of the program in terminal:
```{bash echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
fastqc -h
```
To open R from terminal, type:
```{bash echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
R
```

# Quality control
FastQC is an application which runs quality checks to produce a report to quickly assess the overall quality of your run, and to spot any sequencing problem. Please watch the Youtube tutorial before use: [Using FastQC to check the quality of high throughput sequence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bz93ReOv87Y)

To run FastQC, type in terminal:
```{bash echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
fastqc <sample>.R1.fastq.gz
```

# Download reference genome with pre-built indexes
Genome indexing is a time- and memory-intense procedure, but it needs to be done only once for a given genome. For M. musculus, UCSC mm10 reference genome, the genome with its pre-built Bowtie 2 indexes are available to download from the *Indexes* panel on the right side of the [Bowtie 2](http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/bowtie2/index.shtml) webpage. 
To download, type in terminal:
```{bash echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
wget ftp://ftp.ccb.jhu.edu/pub/data/bowtie2_indexes/mm10.zip
```
To unzip the zip file, type:
```{bash echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
unzip mm10.zip -d <your_destination_folder>
```
When the unzip command completes, the current directory will contain the index files that end with .1.bt2, .2.bt2, .3.bt2, .4.bt2, .rev.1.bt2, and .rev.2.bt2.

# Alignment with Bowtie 2
Stay in the directory that contains the mm10 index files. To align paired-end reads included with Bowtie 2, type in terminal:
```{bash echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
nohup bowtie2 -x mm10 -1 <file_path_R1>.fastq.gz -2 <file_path_R2>.fastq.gz -S <your_file_name>.sam &
```
To explain the above command line:
```{bash echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
# Nohup stands for no hang up, which means to execute the command in the background, even after you lot out
nohup <your_command> &
```
```{bash echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
# Argument -x indicates the basename of the indexed reference genome. 
bowtie2 -x mm10
```
```{bash echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
# Sequence filename usually includes _1, or _2, e.g. R1 or R2
-1 <file_path_R1>.fastq.gz -2 <file_path_R2>.fastq.gz
```
```{bash echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
# The alignment results in SAM format are written to <your_file_name>.sam.
-S <your_file_name>.sam
```

When use nohup command, please write down PID of this process, for checking if the process is complete later on.
